### What will be sold?

Bitcoin financial systems readiness. This is a narrower scope that applies SOC like principles to Bitcoin-only systems.

&

Proof-of-reserves reporting.


Key difference:

**Not** all IT (ERP, HR/payroll, databases, user access), **only** systems around Bitcoin treasury, custody and transaction data.

**Not** promising an audit of PoR, **only** design the controls to generate the standardized reports.


### Will this accidentally drift into investment advice or securities territory?

No. I am not opining on bitcoin as an asset, or unit of account. My focus is systems built on top of the Bitcoin network.

The whitepaper makes a clear distinction between "bitcoin" (with lowercase), which is the coin you can buy, and "Bitcoin" (with capitalcase), which is the network protocol.

This is not bitcoin exposure, wallet management, or investment risk assessment. This work is analogous to SOC 1/2 readiness.


### How much money will this cost the firm?

1. Anticipated costs

I already have the Bitcoin address-level analyzer tool needed for the heavy lifting (retreival of the raw blockchain data formatted in excel)

No licensing fees since it's KRP IP.

2. Staffing costs

I would not require any additional staff support

Personal time to polish documentation reports: 12 - 15 billable hours

3. Marketing costs

Update the cryptocurrency audit page from the KRP website: 5-10 billable hours

4. Insurance rider, if required

Current should cover (I THINK), but if not, an additional $10k/year.

### What are the liabilities to the firm?

We will not handle client assets, private keys, or provide investment advice. Services are strictly for preparation and documentation. Signed disclaimers in every report and engagement will make it very clear.

Residual liability is tied to reputational risk, which can be controlled through insurance review and brand separation (if needed).

### What are the physical deliverables the client expects?

1. Written report containing assessment of current systems (custody, transaction processing, reconciliations), identification of current risks (if any), **system design improvements for better address-level data.** This report will be delivered as a PDF e-file.

2. Proof-of-reserves report with documentation of how historical data can be retreived and reconciled in an on-going basis. This reports provides a framework on what information SHOULD be included to make the P-o-R relevant.It will be delivered as a PDF e-file.

3. Standardized data pack as structured excel workbooks containing address-level metrics. This will be delivered as a zip-folder.

### What are the benefits to the firm?

Exploring an new experimental revenue stream with minimal cost, and creating new referral pathways to core KRP services: inheritance, tax, and (what I am aiming for) audit.

### What are the success metrics for the pilot year?

Number of clients: 3

Number of engagements: 3

Engagement size:

- Standardized data pack (20k)
- System design readiness (40k)
- P-o-R readiness (50k)

Financial metrics:

- Gross revenue expectations: 60k < 150k
- Approximate gross margin: >70% (Since costs are mostly staff time, the margins are very plum)

### What will be some risk mitigation controls?

1. Disclaimers in all client-facing documents

2. Clear policies: no asset handling or investment advice

3. Insurance review and coverage confirmation

4. Ensure that my work related to crypto audits under JDR remains constant and delivered on time

### What marketing costs are associated with this project?

Minimal. The updated webpage on the webflow site and one launch post. Beyond this, client acquisition will be organic, testing word of mouth first year to determine if a more complex strategy will be needed for Y2.

### What is the cost structure for each engagement?

Intake session: 1-2 billable hours

Then depending on the service, for:

- Standardized data packs (less than 4 billable hours)

- System design readiness (between 12 and 16 billable hours)

- P-o-R readiness (between 4 and 8 billable hours)

### Profit split as a bonus incentive

Question to JDR:

Is it possible to tie my bonus to this? The firm retains 90% of net profit, and I receive 10% as bonus?

### What are the legal and compliance risks?

Primary risks are misperception as investment advice or inadequate disclaimers. Legal review will confirm compliance boundaries before launch.

### Is there any risk to brand reputation?

Minimal if framed correctly. Messaging must make it clear this is a niche, highly-specialized consulting service within the firm.

### What are the next 5 year projections?

I rather answer this question after the pilot question is completed. Right now, my only evidence of this being a needed service are informal experiences and a "receipt" for a 17k payment for one engagement that took 4 hours from start to finish.
